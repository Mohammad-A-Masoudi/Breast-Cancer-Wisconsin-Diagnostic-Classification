# Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin-Diagnostic-Classification

In this project, I am comparing a Aritificial Neural Networks and a Random Forest model in terms of model accuracy using breast cancer wisconsin diagnostic. Neural networks accuracy is estimated 95% and random forest accuracy after hyper parameter optimization is estimated 92.5%. 
I am using Sklearn and Keras APIs in python for making the classification algorithms.
